###Client
Large American movie production company


###Question
We are a large American movie production company.  A substantial number of movies are currently in the works, slated to be released over the next year or so in the US. However, our plans for international distribution have not been finalized. In order to help us create these plans, we would like to know if it is possible to predict international release success in Eastern Asia (as a region or by country)?  


###Population of Movies
Produced in US
Released in US and Asia


###Possible features of movies
US gross
Asian gross
Budget
Director
Actors
Genre 
Reviews
Initial release location (if some aren’t released in US first)
Delay between US release dates and Asian release dates

###Harder:
What gets censored (genre trends?)
Location of movie (where is plot set)

###Minimum Viable Project
Some model predicting East Asian gross (Budget, Director, Actors, month of release)
A few interesting facts for US vs Asia (e.g.: what genres are risker, what are sure fire hits for each region)

——————————————————————————————————————————————————
###To do
get genres
find difference between us and foreign release date
count number of actors that are from East Asian in films (by country)
scrape all movies
