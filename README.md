For a blog post describing this project, [click here](https://www.idcrane.com/blog/2014/10/23/predicting-east-asian-movie-success/)

All work is done from the IPython notebook, using classes and methods from the other .py files. 

No data  files exist in repo, they will be generated automatically when running the notebook. 
This process will take a few minutes.

TODO: Fix issue with secondary Wikipedia actor pages. 
Copies exist in local data directory, but not in the repo
